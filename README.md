# Cap Stone For Folasha'de Lateef
This is my week 7 repository. I have various projects that I have revamped with what I have learned throughout the course. This project has the following: An "about" page that speaks about myself, my family, and my love for plants. A gallery page with images of my family, myself, my countless plants, and even some of my favorite singer Beyonce'. Lastly , you will see new and revamped coding projects created by me. I hope you enjoy.
# About
I am a New Orleans native born to Nigerian parents. I am a college graduate with an Associates degree in Generl Studies with an minor in English. I have been married for 3 years with an 8 month old son who is my world! I am a "Phytophile", which is a lover of plants. I own over 100 house plants and I am learning how to build my own greenhouse. 

I am new to the world of coding and this project showcases how much I have learned and how much I have fallen in love with coding. In my projects you will see all that I have learned from HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap.
